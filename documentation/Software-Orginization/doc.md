# Software Organization

In the S.U.N.K. Robotics Corporation organization and division of labor is of the utmost importance. In order to avoid confusion and proverbially "stepping on each others toes", we have made clear cut roles that can be changed and bent if needed. Although all members of the software team will be able to work on any aspect of the project, this will allow each segment of the project to have a main person to look towards for assistance.

* Noah - UI - A GUI need to pilot the ROV
* Matty - Main Server - The server on the ROV needed to communicate with topside station and control hardware
* Scott - Computer Vision - Computer vision needed for completion of autonomous tasks and to assist the pilot
